# project-ideas-for-web-developers

_The_ go-to repo for fun, cool and unique web developer projects. 

June 24 update: In the next few days I'll be reformatting this so that each project idea will link to its own page containing a project description, suggested languages/frameworks, and additional feature ideas. 

# Frontend Ideas
## Time Management App
A website with a stopwatch functionality that is used by users that want to focus on a task for a certain amount of time. 
It can even have a Tomato Timer feature which means that every 25 minutes, your app will tell the user to take a 5 minute break. 
You can add small CSS animations while the stopwatch is counting to make your app unique!

This can even one day be expanded to a full-stack app where users can keep track of how many hours they have studied in the last week, month, etc.
