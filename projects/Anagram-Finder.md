Anagrams are words/phrases that are formed by rearranging the letters of other words/phrases.

Here are some examples of anagrams:
* dormitory = dirty room
* listen = silent
* anagram = nag a ram
* night = thing

Fun little things. 

Create an anagram finder. 

Use an endpoint that takes a string and returns an anagram. 

From there you can create a database that stores the results. 


The longer the strings, the more wildly entertaining anagrams you'll get back.
