## Audio Player

Do you hear what I hear? Is that a themed radio with all the '80s metal you can handle? 

Or maybe it's your favorite local band's album, classical study mix, standup comedy, whale songs, or podcast compilation. 

Whatever you choose, you can customize this audio player with your pick of:
* artwork - album cover, bespoke pics, genre-style images (punks, neon designs, cowboy boots & horses, etc.)
* layout - location of artwork, player buttons, main page navigation
* button stylings - size of buttons, images on buttons, color, etc.

You can get styling inspiration from Spotify, Bandcamp, ReverbNation and others.
