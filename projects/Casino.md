## Casino

Roll out the big app -- an entire casino.

We're talking all the floor games:
* Blackjack
* Craps
* Baccarat
* Poker
* Roulette
* Backgammon

*The list goes on.*

This app has the potential to be as massive as you want it to be, especially if you decide to create multiplayer or computer-generated opponent options.

There are other visual variables like point-of-view, overhead, player by player, etc.

If you want to go all out, create scene breaks. For example, if the user is on a winning streak, stop the game and pan to the suits in the security room watching the table, raising their eyebrows and talking about keeping an eye on that player. 

Or if they're losing miserably and choose to play a different game, cut to a scene of their avatar slamming down their cards and storming off. 


**Bonus:** Add the *Slot Machine* app from our frontend project ideas.
