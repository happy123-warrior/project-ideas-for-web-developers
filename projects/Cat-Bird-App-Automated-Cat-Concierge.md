## Cat Bird App - Automated Cat Concierge

The Automated Cat Concierge is a take on the classic move of turning on the nature channel so your cat can watch the birds... And attack the TV screen if they're so inclined.

The difference with this app is that it can be *interactive.* So if you have a spare phone or tablet laying around, set that up and let your cat go crazy with the on-screen wildlife. Touch-responsive fowl can be swiped off the screen to make way for new fluttering critters. 

The fun never stops!

Why limit it to birds? The Automated Cat Concierge can also feature squirrels, fish, and other fidgety consumables.
