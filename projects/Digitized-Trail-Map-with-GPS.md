## Digitized Trail Map with GPS

For those of us that like hiking, it's nice having that little paper copy of a trail map you get at the visitor's center... if they're open... and if they have any left. 

And the occasional maps along the trail are helpful to get you to the next point... but that's still pretty limiting.

A digitized trail map with GPS could solve these problems. You'd be able to interact with a live map pinpointing your exact location. This would minimize getting lost, wondering how far the next stopping point is, and trying to figure out how much further your final destination is. 

You could even get more creative and build in personal rest areas, times, or eating breaks.

And if you want to get really serious, you can include things like:

* altitude
* difficulty level
* animals indigenous to the area
* current/future weather predictions in the area
* historical facts

And any other relevant points of interest.
