## Food Find in CSS

Here's a fun app challenge: 

Take a photo of some food you spot: a juicy steak with asparagus and potatoes, tofu dog on a gluten-free bun, Cinnabon classic cinnamon roll, or Wendy's $5 Biggie Bag and recreate it in CSS.

If you want to get more in depth, have fun with different themes like 7-course dinners, desserts or appetizers.
