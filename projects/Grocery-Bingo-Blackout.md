## Grocery Bingo Blackout

Who knew shopping could be so fun?

Grocery Bingo Blackout is perfect for sending your boo out on a grocery run. Let's say they need to make a midnight Wal Mart run and you need them to get:
1. toilet paper
2. sponges
3. chips
4. frozen empanadas
5. chocloate

Instead of spelling it all out, make a brand-specific Bingo Blackout board! That way they can have fun while checking off each item on the list.

And once they've made BINGO, they can head up to the check out and back on home. 

Leave nothing to the imagination as they seek out that Charmin ultra-soft 48 mega roll pack, Scotch Brite non-scratch scrub sponge, Doritos Flamin' Hot Limon family size bag, Brazi Bites chicken & cheese empanadas, and king size Reese's peanut butter cups.

Fun to play with kids too. 
Make shopping fun for the whole family!
