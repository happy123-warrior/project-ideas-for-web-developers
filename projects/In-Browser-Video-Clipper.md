## In-Browser Video Clipper

Taking a screenshot is easy with just a few button clicks.

But what about grabbing just a small section of a video, a few seconds or moments? As of now, you can't cut and paste that awesomely rad or educational video clip. 

Imagine if you could have that 30-second clip at the ready for how to make perfect sous vide eggs, or how to properly put an anchor in drywall, or just want to show your buddy the Star Wars filibuster by Patton Oswalt. And all without having to scroll through all the other stuff?

An in-browser video clipper would save space on your computer. Plus you could do other things with your time instead of aimlessly scrolling for that one piece of video you need.
