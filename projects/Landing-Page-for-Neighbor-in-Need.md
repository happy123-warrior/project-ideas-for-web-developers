## Landing Page for Neighbor in Need

Charitable donations are a great way to beef up your project repertoire. And there's always someone in need: A down-on-their-luck neighbor, your aging aunt, or even the local non-profit who's struggling to get going. 

Lending a helping hand can help you improve your developer skills while bettering the lives of those who are gifted your services (who would otherwise be unable to obtain them). 

Plus, it always feels good to be a positive part of a solution.
