## Micky D's Map Navigation Generator

Many of us are visual learners. So when it comes to directions, "take a right on Main then go 2.5 miles and take a right on Route 6 for 17 miles until you hit Charles Road and turn off onto Charles Street. Take that until you end up..." means a whole lot of nothing. 

But what if there was an app that gave directions based on one of the most popular landmarks today: McDonald's?
As of 2019, there were over 13,000 McDonald's restaurants in the US. 

You could literally travel across the country using nothing but directions to the next McDonald's.
And instead of long-winded directions using unfamiliar street names, the voice navigation can direct you to "turn right at the next McDonald's. In 30 miles, you'll see a McDonald's on your left. Then, turn left."

We just need an app for it...
