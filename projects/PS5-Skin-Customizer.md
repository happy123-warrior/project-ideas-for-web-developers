## PS5 Skin Customizer

The PlayStation 5 is host to some of the coolest games in the world: Doom Eternal, Elder Scrolls, Assassin's Creed, GTA 5, the list goes on and on.

*But it looks boring.*

Create an app where the user can style different skins for their PS5. It could be scenes from your favorite game, favorite snack logos (holler to all my Mountain Dew Code Red and Flamin' Hot Cheetos fans), or even your favorite place IRL. Give the option to use stock photos, or let them upload their own.
