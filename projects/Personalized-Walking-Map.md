## Personalized Walking Map

Whether you live in a city, suburb, or rural area, a Personalized Walking Map can come in handy.

And it could be put together in many different ways:
1. Common walking routines
2. Places you haven't walked yet but want to
3. Planned by desired distance
4. Planned by accessiblity (you don't want to be walking on a highway)
5. Mapped to avoid high-crime areas or major events
6. Charted by difficulty (flat land, steep inclines, steps, etc...)

And more. 


Personalized walking maps will encourage fitness, accessibility and safety with pedestrian routes.
