## Photograph Item/Get Dimensions

Ever wonder how big something is when you're at the store, on a hike, dumpster diving, etc.? Most of us don't always carry a measuring tape, but we've usually got a smartphone handy. 

So what if you created an app that can get those dimensions for you! 
All the user would have to do is take a photograph of the item. From there, your app would take care of the rest. 

By assessing the item's size in relation to distance from the phone and other surroundings, it could deliver an accurate size estimate to the user.
