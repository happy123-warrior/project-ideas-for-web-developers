## Recreating Fairytales

Fairytales can be lightly whimsical (Disney) or deeply dark and terrifying (Brothers Grimm).


Using CSS and perhaps JavaScript, recreate a scene, illustration, or animation from your favorite fairytale, the way *you* envision it.

If fairytales aren't your thing, recreate a scene from Fallout Boy, action movie or music video. Or anything else that you'd like to recreate better than the original.
