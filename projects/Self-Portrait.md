## Self-Portrait

Allow users to create a drag-and-drop self-portrait using CSS. 

The user can compile these images to create a realistic or distorted self-portrait. Heck, it could even be animated!

And don't forget these features:
* face shape
* skin tone
* eye color and shape
* hair color and style
* nose style
* mouth style (serious, smiliing, frowning)
* ear style
* moles, tags, birthmarks, etc.

And any other unique characteristics you can think of.


Images can be actual photographs, cartoon, or even caricature-like in nature.
