## Self-Portrait

Allow users to create a drag-and-drop self-portrait. 

Let them choose pre-loaded images based on:
* face shape
* skin tone
* eye color and shape
* hair color and style
* nose style
* mouth style (serious, smiliing, frowning)
* ear style
* moles, tags, birthmarks, etc.

And any other unique characteristics you can think of.

The user can compile these images to create a realistic or distorted self-portrait.

Images can be actual photographs, cartoon, or even charicature-like in nature.
