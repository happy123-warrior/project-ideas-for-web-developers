## Sushi Tracker

~~Some~~ Most of us are familiar with the Domino's Pizza Tracker app. Instead of staring at the clock wondering if they're going to be ringing your door bell in 5 minutes or an hour, you have the soft, pulsating glow of assurance showing you what stage of production your pizza's in. 

But this would also be great for sushi!

You could see:
1. what time the sushi rolls are started
2. who is making the sushi rolls
3. the quality check
4. when they're boxed up
5. when they're out for delivery

And if you don't like sushi, create a food tracker app on for something else.
