## Sushi Tracker

~~Some~~ Most of us are familiar with the Domino's Pizza Tracker app. Instead of staring at the clock wondering if they're going to be ringing your door bell in 5 minutes or an hour, you have the soft, pulsating glow of assurance showing you the status of your pizza.

But this would also be great for sushi!

You could see:
1. what time the sushi rolls are started
2. who is making the sushi rolls
3. the quality check
4. when they're boxed up
5. when they're out for delivery

For each stage you could have different music that plays to set the mood, or different pop-up facts about sushi. 

And if you don't like sushi, create a food tracker app for something else: Chinese food, sandwiches, Italian, or any other delicious delivery (or pick-up) option.
