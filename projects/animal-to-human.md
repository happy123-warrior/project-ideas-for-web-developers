## Animal to Human Years Calculator

Most of us have heard that 1 human year = 7 dog years. 

But what we *haven't* heard is our age in relation to animals like:
* wombats
* squirrels
* ostriches
* pigs
* kangaroos
* zebras
* impalas
* wildabeests
* polar bears

Well, you get the point.

Create an app where users can:
1. Select the animal they want to compare ages with
2. Input their age which then converts to the animal's age

Set it up to apply to one animal, or create a list that converts the user's age to the ages of all listed animals.

This app will take quite a bit of research but will provide awesome results with hours of entertainment.
