## A Dating Site Exclusively for Developers 

It's hard getting into the dating scene when we sit in front of computers all day. And let's be honest: a lot of people don't get what we do. Some of us either don't want to explain what we do (for the 100th time), or would rather date someone that complements our working style.

So what if there was a dating site exclusively for developers?

It could share similarities with OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, eHarmony, Match. But of course it'd have its own flair like developer-related romance questions, tech-themed visuals, and vital stats like age, sex, location, stack, etc.
