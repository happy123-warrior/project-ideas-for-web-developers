## A Dating Site Exclusively for Developers 

It's hard getting into the dating scene when we sit in front of computers all day. And let's be honest: a lot of people don't get what we do. Some of us either don't want to explain what we do (for the 100th time), or would rather date someone that complements our working lifestyle.

So what if there was a dating site exclusively for developers?

It could share similarities with OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, eHarmony, or Match. Users can input a series of developer-related romance questions:
* A/S/L
* stack
* tech interests
* interests outside of tech

From there they can indicate they "like" each other with a button, connect using a messaging app, or block them if they're not interested.

Or make it a bit more user-friendly with a Tinder-style layout where:
* swipe one direction = Let's meet
* swipe another direction = Take your database and ergonomic wireless mouse and buzz off
