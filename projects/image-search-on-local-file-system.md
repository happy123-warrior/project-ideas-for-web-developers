Finding images using a third party is pretty non-cerebral. A few buzz words and a couple clicks later, you've access to pretty much any picture you want.

Build an app to search your local file system to pull up the client projection infographic you made for your upcoming meeting.
Or the shot of the fender bender for your insurance agent.

Use sample images as test subjects as you trial and error your way through this project.
