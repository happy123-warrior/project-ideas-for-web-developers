## Market Highlights

Create a customized user interface (UI) chart for stock investors. 

This UI should give investors the ability to see market/stock highlights based on their time specifications. 

For example, one click to see minute-to-minute highlights of a specific stock; one click to see daily highlights; one click to see weekly highlights, etc.

Bonus: multiple UIs that simultaneously show highlights for minute-to-minute, daily, weekly, etc.
