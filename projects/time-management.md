## Time Management App

Imagine an app with a built-in stopwatch where users can focus on work until the alert sounds. They can devote their complete attention to the task at hand instead of constantly checking their clock, phone, or watch. 

A lot of developers use the Pomodoro Technique, so there could even be a special 25-minute Pomodoro work/study session followed by a 5-minute break. Bonus for tomato timer visuals or other CSS animations throughout your app.


This can even be expanded to a full-stack app where users can keep track of how many hours they have studied in the last week, month, etc.
